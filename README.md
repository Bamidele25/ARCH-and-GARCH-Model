# ARCH-and-GARCH-Model
ARCH n GARCH Model for Exchange rate Volatility 

The task compare Naira volatility during two regimes in Nigeria Using ARCH and GARCH model, it focus on comparing the performance two regimes in Nigeria exchange rate series for Naira/GBP, Naira/USD, and Naira/Yuan over the period of 2012-2018. The data is divided into two regimes firstly from (2012) to (2015) and secondly (2015) to (2018) in order to compare the performance of those series in the two regimes. 

The report from the project shows that there exist unit root in the all the exchange rate series for the both regime at level, the pattern of the time series plot display high tendency for all the exchange rate series in the second regime while downward tendency was observed in the first regime, the series display the presence of ARCH effect for the both regime which lead to the use of ARCH and GARCH model to fit the series, for the Akiake Information Criterion it was observed that GARCH (1,1) is the best model to fit all the series.
